    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe by Chef John breaks down the processes that yield Persian rice's signature qualities: fluffy grains, the tahdig layer, and some bonus potato tahdig nestled on top. It's not quite how my grandmother makes it, but it's definitely worth trying.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 quarts water
            
            <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed</li>          
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>         
            <li>1 russet potato, cut into Â¼-inch slices</li>            
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>  
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place water and kosher salt in a pot; bring to a boil. Add rice; cook and stir for exactly 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover bottom of the pot with 1 layer of potato slices. Sprinkle cumin and salt over potatoes. Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with rice to form an even layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over rice.
        </li>
    </ol>
